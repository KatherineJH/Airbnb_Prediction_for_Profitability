Ensemble machine learning techniques with hyperparameter optimisations for Italian Airbnb data to predict profitability from an investment perspective. <br>

### This project used Italian Airbnb data from Kaggle.com and merged 10 different cities' data into one file.<br>
First, download the CSV file through the link below.<br>

### There are 3 parts notebook files, Preprocessing, modelling and evaluation visualisations. <br>
The preprocessing file includes EDA, Preprocessing and visualisations.<br>
The modelling file includes 6 different ensemble models with 2 different hyperparameter optimisation approaches.<br>
The eval visual file compares the methods in 10 different cities in Italy.<br>
